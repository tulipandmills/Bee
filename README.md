Project Bee

Why would we structure data by types and objects? What is the difference between data and data types?
Grocery lists, ToDo lists, collections of phone numbers, pictures, calendars... we collect them everywhere because of this seperation of data types (phone number != appointment).

This is an experiment to offer a collection that supports any data type, or none, so to say.
